## Course Resources

 ### General

[Course website](https://cs186berkeley.net/fa20/): I used the 2021 spring version.

[Recorded videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/CS186Berkeley/playlists): I watched the recorded videos on Youtube, you can also find the same videos on bilibili. 

Vitamin:  Vitamins are short, weekly assignments to keep you on schedule and check your understanding of the basics from lecture. However these assignments are not open to the public, you can find them on the [Edx's archived CS186W](https://learning.edge.edx.org/course/course-v1:BerkeleyX+CS186+2018_SP/). You can also download the ppt and watch course videos on Edx.
